## üö® General Incident Response Playbook

### Phase 1: Initial Response (0-1 Hour)
```bash
# Immediate Actions Checklist
‚ñ° Confirm incident validity
‚ñ° Assess initial scope and impact
‚ñ° Notify incident response team
‚ñ° Begin documentation (incident log)
‚ñ° Implement initial containment if safe
‚ñ° Preserve volatile evidence
‚ñ° Establish communication channels
```

### Phase 2: Assessment and Containment (1-4 Hours)
```bash
# Assessment Actions
# Network traffic analysis
tcpdump -i eth0 -w incident_capture.pcap
netstat -tulpn > network_connections.txt

# System process analysis
ps aux > running_processes.txt
lsof > open_files.txt

# Memory capture (if possible)
dd if=/dev/mem of=memory_dump.img bs=1MB

# Disk imaging
dd if=/dev/sda of=/mnt/evidence/disk_image.img bs=512 conv=noerror,sync
```

### Phase 3: Deep Analysis (4-24 Hours)
```python
# Log analysis script example
import re
import datetime

def analyze_security_logs(log_file):
    """Analyze security logs for indicators of compromise."""
    indicators = {
        'suspicious_ips': [],
        'malicious_processes': [],
        'unusual_network_activity': [],
        'privilege_escalations': []
    }
    
    with open(log_file, 'r') as f:
        for line in f:
            # Check for suspicious IP patterns
            if re.search(r'failed login.*from (\d+\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+)', line):
                ip = re.search(r'(\d+\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+)', line).group(1)
                indicators['suspicious_ips'].append(ip)
            
            # Check for privilege escalation
            if 'sudo' in line and 'root' in line:
                indicators['privilege_escalations'].append(line.strip())
    
    return indicators
```

## üîç Digital Forensics Integration

### Evidence Collection Procedures
```bash
# Create forensic image with verification
dd if=/dev/sda conv=sync,noerror bs=64K | tee disk_image.dd | sha256sum > image_hash.txt

# Collect volatile data
echo "=== System Information ===" > volatile_data.txt
uname -a >> volatile_data.txt
date >> volatile_data.txt
uptime >> volatile_data.txt

echo "=== Network Connections ===" >> volatile_data.txt
netstat -tulpn >> volatile_data.txt
ss -tulpn >> volatile_data.txt

echo "=== Running Processes ===" >> volatile_data.txt
ps auxwwf >> volatile_data.txt

echo "=== Open Files ===" >> volatile_data.txt
lsof >> volatile_data.txt

echo "=== Loaded Modules ===" >> volatile_data.txt
lsmod >> volatile_data.txt

# Hash calculation for evidence integrity
find /path/to/evidence -type f -exec sha256sum {} \; > evidence_hashes.txt
```
